# Cisco Packet Tracer Project

![Cisco Packet Tracer Logo](images/cisco_logo.png)

This project contains a Cisco Packet Tracer file (`Cisco Packet Tracer.pkt`) that can be used to simulate and analyze network configurations and topologies. Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool that allows users to practice networking concepts and experiment with network behavior.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following:

1. **Cisco Packet Tracer Installed**: Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer from the [official Cisco website](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. **Cisco Networking Academy Account**: You need to sign in with your Cisco Networking Academy account to use Cisco Packet Tracer. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free on the [Cisco Networking Academy website](https://www.netacad.com/).

## How to Use

1. **Sign In to Cisco Packet Tracer**:
   - Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Sign in using your Cisco Networking Academy credentials.

2. **Open the Project File**:
   - Click on `File` > `Open` in Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Navigate to the location of the `Cisco Packet Tracer.pkt` file and open it.

3. **Explore the Network Topology**:
   - Once the file is loaded, you can view the network topology.
   - Use the simulation mode to analyze packet flow and troubleshoot network issues.

4. **Modify the Topology** (Optional):
   - Add or remove devices, configure settings, and experiment with different network scenarios.

5. **Save Your Changes**:
   - If you make any modifications, save your work by clicking `File` > `Save As`.

## Features

- Pre-configured network topology for learning and experimentation.
- Compatible with Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.0 and above.
- Ideal for practicing networking concepts such as routing, switching, and subnetting.

## License
